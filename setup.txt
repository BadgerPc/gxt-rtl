Quick Setup for Ext GWT 2.X RTL
===========================

Note : Ext GWT 2.X requires GWT 1.7+ or GWT 2.0+ (any build ending in "-gwt2.zip"). 

STEP 1 -> Create a Google Web Application Project project within Eclipse.

Copy the contents of the /resources folder in the download to a {foldername} location within your war folder.
Substitute {foldername} with the name of the folder you've created for resources within your war folder. 

STEP 3 -> Add the following stylesheet to your host page:

In case of LTR version
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{foldername}/css/gxt-all.css" />

In case of RTL version
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{foldername}/css/gxt-all-rtl.css" />

gxt-all-rtl.css is a full replacement of gxt-all.css so you don't need to add both to your host page.
All the standard themens has own RTL css sets and they will be added automatically depend on locale.

STEP 3b -> If you are using Charts, add the following script to your host page.

<script language='javascript' src='{foldername}/flash/swfobject.js'></script>

STEP 4 -> Add the following entry to you projects module xml file.

<inherits name='com.extjs.gxt.ui.GXT'/>
